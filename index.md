## About Me

My name is Lauren Willson, and I am a sophomore Biomedical Engineering Student at Cornell University. Outside of my BME classes, I'm involved in a lot of student groups on campus include the SensTech project team, Cornell EMS, and club tennis. When I'm not studying or sneaking in a gym session or two, I enjoy scoping out all the niche cafes on campus and exploring the beautiful scenery around us here in Ithaca.
