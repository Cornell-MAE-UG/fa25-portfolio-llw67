## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Lauren Willson, and I am a sophomore Biomedical Engineering Student at Cornell University. Outside of my BME classes, I'm involved in a lot of student groups on campus include the SensTech project team, Cornell EMS, and club tennis. When I'm not studying or sneaking in a gym session or two, I enjoy scoping out all the niche cafes on campus just to order the same caramel skim milk latte and performatively walking around with my wired earphones in.

Take a look at [my projects](https://cornell-mae-ug.github.io/fa25-portfolio-llw67/projects.md)</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
