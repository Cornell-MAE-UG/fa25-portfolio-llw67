## About Me


![Profile Picture](assets/images/profile-pic.jpg)

 
My name is Lauren Willson, and I am a sophomore Biomedical Engineering Student at Cornell University. Outside of my BME classes, I'm involved in a lot of student groups on campus include the SensTech project team, Cornell EMS, and club tennis. When I'm not studying or sneaking in a gym session or two, I enjoy scoping out all the niche cafes on campus just to order the same caramel skim milk latte and performatively walking around with my wired earphones in.

Take a look at my projects<a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}"></a> and CV <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}"></a>.
